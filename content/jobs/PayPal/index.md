- I started with learning and understanding KrakenJS, which is the main pillar of PayPal framework. Kraken keeps the code organized by splitting up the configuration, content, templates and routing logic into different places so that itâ€™s easy to keep track of everything and to easily swap out components.
- Architected and implemented the frontend in React, HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, and jQuery and ensured mid-tier API Handling was done so that the application interacts with the Backend Services which used Elastic Search.
-  Interfaced with senior developers on a weekly basis, providing technological expertise.
